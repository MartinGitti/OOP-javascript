### Use of code:
<p>Please feel free to use the code of the projects above.</p>
<p>I've made use of a text editor to put all of my code together and used Google Chrome as my default browser to view my Web Pages.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, I'd suggest using a Text Editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</p>
